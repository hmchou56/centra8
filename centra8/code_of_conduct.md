## Code of Conduct

The CENTRA 7 organizing committee values the diversity of views, expertise, opinions, backgrounds, and experiences reflected among our partners and the broader community and is committed to providing a safe, productive, and welcoming environment for all participants. This Code of Conduct is in place to ensure an inclusive, supportive, and collaborative environment for all people and cultures.  

The Code of Conduct applies to attendees, speakers, volunteers, organizers, members of the media, vendors, and service providers. It applies in all venues, including ancillary events and social gatherings of CENTRA 7.  

We expect everyone to respect the following list of behaviors.  

**Expected Behavior**  

- Treat everyone with kindness, respect, and consideration, valuing a diversity of views and opinions (including those you may not share).  
- Treat others with respect, including the use of their preferred name and personal pronouns.
- Exhibit professional behavior at all times.  
- Communicate openly, with respect for others, critiquing ideas rather than individuals.  
- Be mindful of your surroundings and of others. Alert conference staff if you notice a dangerous situation or someone in distress.  
- Respect the rules and policies of the meeting venue, hotels, CENTRA-contracted facility, or any other venue.  

**Unacceptable Behavior**   
- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination in any form including, but not limited to:  
  - Physical or verbal abuse.  
  - Exclusionary behavior and microaggressions related to age, appearance or body size, employment or military status, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, individual lifestyle, marital status, national origin, physical or cognitive ability, political affiliation, sexual orientation, race, or religion. 
  - Inappropriate physical contact.
  - Unwanted sexual attention.
  - Use of sexual or discriminatory images in public spaces or in presentations.
  - Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following.
  - Sustained disruption of talks or other events.
  - Bullying behavior, including intentional microaggressions.
  - Retaliation for reporting unacceptable behavior.
  - Unacceptable behavior conveyed in a manner of joking still constitutes unacceptable behavior.  


**Reporting Incidents**  
Anyone experiencing or witnessing behavior that constitutes an immediate or serious threat to public safety at any time should immediately notify any of the CENTRA 7 organizers in person.  

If you are not in immediate danger but feel that you are the subject of unacceptable behavior, have witnessed any such behavior, or have other concerns, report the incident to one of the conference organizers (as soon as possible) who will work to resolve the situation.   

Conference organizers will treat all reports seriously and will work to understand the situation through prompt investigation, including conversations with relevant individuals and witnesses before determining an appropriate course of action.
