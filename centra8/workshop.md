## Abstract Submission for Cloud-Edge Fusion for the Computing Continuum

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has enormous potential, but its impact can differ depending on the local environment. We cordially invite CENTRA's researchers, practitioners, and professionals to submit brief abstracts for a one-day event exploring the worldwide views of AI within the Edge-Cloud-HPC Continuum. This workshop will feature a collection of concise papers on AI and edge computing, with a particular emphasis on:
- Regional or global issues in the continuum from edge to cloud infrastructure
- Global research partnerships for rapid responses to global issues
- Post 5G/6G architectures and implications for AI applications
- AI applications in the context of continuum computing
- Lightweight and efficient AI models for edge devices, Edge-based AI inference optimization techniques
- Resource management, workload allocation, data sharing in edge-cloud systems,
- Hybrid edge-cloud architectures for advanced AI applications
- AI ethics, trustworthiness, and governance

<!--[A draft schedule for the workshop is available via SCHED](https://centra6.sched.com/)-->
