# Application Domains

The activities of this project aim to advance the scientific understanding of distributed software-defined cyberinfrastructures and the ability to run scientific applications using data and tools in different countries. Specifically, the targeted applications are in environmental modeling, disaster management and smart and connected communities, focusing on how these domains impact each other. 

# IT Research

The related middleware research seeks solutions for software-defined data sharing, middleware interoperability via software-definition, and coordinated software-definition of distributed IT systems.

# Projects

To be announced.

# Testbeds and Resources

The following testbeds and systems are available to researchers in the CENTRA project.  Click on their acronyms to find out how impressive they are.

- **PRAGMA Experimental Network Testbed** ([PRAGMA-ENT](https://github.com/pragmagrid/pragma_ent/wiki)) - A breakable international software-defined network (SDN) testbed.

- **Japan-wide Orchestrated Smart / Sensor Environment** ([JOSE](http://www.nict.go.jp/en/nrh/nwgn/jose.html)) - A testbed
with a large number of wireless sensors, SDN capabilities, and distributed "CLOUD" resources.

- **StarBED** ([StarBED](http://starbed.nict.go.jp/en/index.html)) A large-scale, general-purpose Internet simulator and a testbed that could be used to carry out multiple, large-scale simulations of next-generation networks for performance and dependability studies.

- **The Resilient ICT Research Center** ([ICT](http://nict.go.jp/en/reict/index.html)) - A research center of the 
National Institute of Information and Communication Technology (NICT) of Japan with the mission to realize "connected" 
and "unbreakable" networks, especially in the case of a disaster, this center aims to advance research into 
resilient ICT technologies.

- **Research Infrastructure for Large-Scale Network Experiments** ([RISE](https://www.jgn.nict.go.jp/nwgn/rise/index.html)) -
A New Generation Network Testbed (NICT JGN-X) wide-area SDN testbed including East Asia, Japan, and the US connected via TEIN.
