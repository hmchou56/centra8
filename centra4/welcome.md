## CENTRA 3 Meeting: Smart Cyberinfrastructure for Transnational Science

<p>
It is with great pleasure that we welcome CENTRA members, friends and visitors to the <i>CENTRA 3 Meeting: Smart Cyberinfrastructure for Transnational Science</i> in Tokyo, Japan. This meeting brings together international CENTRA researchers to review ongoing or new collaboration projects that require contributions from researchers and/or cyberinfrastructure from different countries. This is the third meeting following the <a href="http://www.globalcentra.org/centra2" target="_blank">CENTRA 2 All-Hands Meeting</a> in Gainesville, Florida (2017), and the CENTRA 1 Kickoff Meeting in Taipei, Taiwan (2016). CENTRA continues to mature and grow. In particular, we are very happy to welcome our first member institution from the European Union, <a href="https://www.inesctec.pt/en" target="_blank">INESC TEC</a> from Portugal. We look forward to together coming up with new ideas, demonstrating early prototypes, conceptualizing new projects and advancing science and its applications.

<p>
The CENTRA 3 Meeting: Smart Cyberinfrastructure for Transnational Science on May 14 through 16, follows the PRAGMA 34 Workshop held at Akihabara, Tokyo from May 10 through 11.  The PRAGMA 34 technical program and social activities in the intervening weekend also provide CENTRA attendees with additional opportunities for professional interactions and networking.

CENTRA activities are funded in part by the National Science Foundation (NSF ACI Award 1550126) of the USA, the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) of Taiwan, the National Institute of Information and Communications Technologies (NICT) of Japan, and the Institute for Systems and Computer Engineering, Technology and Science (INESC TEC) of Portugal. We are very thankful for the support of all these sponsors.
